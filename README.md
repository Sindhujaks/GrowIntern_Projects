# GrowIntern ML Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository containing my projects for the GrowIntern ML internship! In this repository, you'll find two projects: **Car Price Prediction** and **Stock Price Prediction**.

## Car Price Prediction

### Overview
In this project, I developed a car price prediction model using the Random Forest algorithm. The objective was to predict the price of cars based on various features such as brand, model year, fuel, transmission, kms_driven, seller_type, etc.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains information about various cars, including their features and prices.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Stock Price Prediction

### Overview
For this project, I built a stock price prediction model using Linear Regression. The aim was to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

### Dataset
The historical stock market data used for this project was sourced from Yahoo Finance.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
